' Light vs Dark reference overlord.

' You command one player, not one unit. Every decision runs from the top of
' this file with a fresh instruction budget, five times a second. Globals and

'
' BUDGET. You get 300000 instructions and 400000 work units per decision.
' That sounds like a lot and it is not: a loop over every unit nested inside
' a loop over every unit will blow through it, the script will be marked
' failed, and your player will stand still for the rest of the match. Scan
' the observation list ONCE and use the nearest* host calls, which do their
' searching inside the host where it is cheap.
