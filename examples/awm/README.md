# AWM — Archers Warriors Mages

Card-game prototype in Nim + Polyworld. Native and browser.

## Native

```sh
nim c -o:awm awm.nim
./awm                                        # bot vs bot, random classes
./awm --human --class warrior --opponent mage # play against a bot
./awm --seed 42                              # fixed deal
```

| Flag | Default |
|---|---|
| `--human` | off (bot vs bot) |
| `--class CLASS` | `archer` |
| `--opponent CLASS` | `mage` |
| `--seed INTEGER` | `20260910` |
| `--bot PATH` | `players/base.bas` |

Bot vs bot ignores `--class`/`--opponent` and picks randomly.

Build with `-d:awmLayoutTuning` to tune the camera and opponent hand live:
Q/A raise/lower the opponent hand, S/W push it away/pull it closer, Y/H raise/lower
your hand, U/J push it away/pull it closer, I/K turn cards in hand about their
long axis, E/D raise/lower
the camera, R/F move it in/out, T/G pitch it down/up, and Enter prints the values
to paste into `awm.nim`.

### Screen effects

`awmpost.nim` renders the 3D scene offscreen and adds screen-space ambient
occlusion (before the VFX), bloom from the light the VFX add, FXAA, a light
grade and a vignette. The HUD is not affected. F8 toggles all of it.

| Variable (native) | Default |
|---|---|
| `AWM_POSTFX=0` | all effects on |
| `AWM_SSAO=0` / `AWM_BLOOM=0` / `AWM_FXAA=0` | each on |
| `AWM_SSAO_RADIUS` | `1.501` world units |
| `AWM_SSAO_INTENSITY` | `3.523` |
| `AWM_SSAO_BIAS` | `0.08` |

Build with `-d:awmPostLayers` to view the intermediate layers: 1 final image,
2 scene before bloom and grading, 3 depth, 4 normals from depth, 5 unblurred
occlusion, 6 occlusion, 7 scene before VFX, 8 light added by VFX, 9 bloom
source, 0 bloom. `AWM_POST_LAYER=N` starts on layer N (for screenshots).

Build with `-d:awmPostPanel` for a draggable tuning window with every setting,
grouped by layer (F9 shows or hides it; with `-d:awmPostLayers` it also picks
the layer). "Print settings" writes the values as Nim for
`defaultPostSettings` in `awmpost.nim`. Clicks over the window don't reach
the board.

## Browser

```sh
./tools/serve.sh                             # build + serve
./tools/build_web.sh                         # build only
AWM_SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1 ./tools/serve.sh       # serve existing build

## Rules

- Choose Archer, Warrior, or Mage.
- 20 life, 40-card class deck, 5-card opening hand.
- Random first player; first player skips their turn draw.
- Each turn: +1 max energy, full replenish, draw one card.
- Minions attack once per turn, starting the turn after they're played:
  click one, then an enemy minion or hero (right-click cancels). Minions
  deal their power to each other; damage stays, and minions at 0
  toughness go to the discard pile.
- Ranged minions take no combat damage from non-ranged minions, whether
  attacking or defending. Spells and on-play effects still damage them.
- Power/toughness buffs are permanent while the minion stays on the board;
  a bounced minion returns to hand with its printed stats. Changed stats
  show green (raised) or red (lowered) on the card. Lost keywords are
  permanent the same way, and show on the card's type line.
- Summoned minions enter at the right of their owner's board. Like played
  minions they attack from their owner's next turn, and their own on-play
  rules don't run. A card's later rules reach them (Rally buffs its own
  Footsoldiers).
- Trinkets (Plan) stay in play on their owner's board but aren't minions:
  they can't attack or be attacked, and minion targets and "all minions"
  effects ignore them.
- `on(nextTurn(...))` rules fire once, at the start of that player's next
  turn after their draw, for the card's owner, if the card is still in
  play. Drawing from an empty deck loses the game, as on a normal turn.
- Cards with several targets (Duel) are aimed one target at a time. A
  fight is combat without an attack: both minions deal their power at
  once, Ranged applies, and it doesn't use up either minion's attack.
- No victory condition yet.
